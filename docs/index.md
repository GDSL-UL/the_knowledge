# The Knowledge

In preparation to be able to stay productive while having to work fully remote, this document presents a few things jotted down in one place to help with setups, etc. 

The first step is a checklist everyone should go through:

1. Do you have a computer to work on at home?
1. Are *all* your relevant files accessible from home?
1. Do you have a webcam, mic and speakers/headphones?
1. Are you able to connect to computers on campus? This involves being setup with the University VPN?

These are the basic elements you will require, so if the answer to any of the above is no, please speak with your PhD supervisor.
