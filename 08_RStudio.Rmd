# Docker Containers for R

A widely-used suite of docker images for R has been developed by the Rocker project [@RJ-2017-065]. 29 repositories of rocker's images are listed on the [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker/) providing R environments customized to perform a variety of tasks. Most of them include R studio server, allowing to work remotely from the R studio server web interface accessible through any browser.

Rocker images are versioned, meaning that if you want to employ a specific version of R rather than the latest you can specify an R version tag in the image name, i.e. *rocker/verse:3.4.0*, if no tag is requested you will automatically pull the latest version [@RJ-2017-065]. 

## Run Docker Locally

To run one of the rocker images locally on your laptop you need to install docker as described in - par ref - and pull the image of your choise from docker hub. 

A great image with the tidyverse + various geospatial packages + Rstudio server is rocker geospatial:

> [`https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial`](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial)

You can pull the repository running the following command:

```
docker pull rocker/geospatial
```

This will require a good internet connection and will take a while, but you
only need to run it once.

Once the image is on your local machine, you can run it with the following command:

```
docker run -d --name rstudio -v ${PWD}:/data -e PASSWORD=secret -p 8787:8787 rocker/geospatial
```
Using this approach, you can store files on your laptop's drive, and access, edit or create new ones from the container (ie. using RStudio).
The command above also sets up a password (`secret`) and username (`rstudio`)
to use when you login to RStudio.

On Windows, this is similar (change `alexa` to your account name - look at your directory structure):

```
docker run -d --name rstudio -v  c:\users\alexa:/home/rstudio/alex -e PASSWORD=secret -p 8787:8787 rocker/geospatial
```

If this runs ok; you access Rstudio server through a browser at: [`http://localhost:8787`](http://localhost:8787)

## Run Docker Remotely

Docker is installed on all our shared resources. Most machines already have images that can be used for gds. Rocker/geospatial has been extended to have all libraries that GDSL members generally use -link to the image-. 

Once you accessed the server you can list the existing images with the following command:

```
docker images ls
```
check ports

run command same specifics of user names and psw.
