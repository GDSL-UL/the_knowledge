# Files

You need to make sure that a) you have access to all of your files and b) that
these are somewhat backed up so it is not entirely reliant on a single device.
The simplest and recommended way to do this at Liverpool is to keep all your
files and data on your university account at OneDrive. This is part of the
Office 365 Suite available from the university, you can find more info at:

There are Windows and Mac clients that work relatively well (equivalent to
Dropbox client).

Once you are set up, copy all your files onto your OneDrive account, which
will create a copy of them in Microsoft's secure cloud. The exception is
where you have data that has requirements to be managed in particular ways - e.g.
only from a single machine etc; not in the cloud.

Please, be sure to speak with your PhD supervisor if you access data that
may pose some challenges when moving from local machines or within the university
network (remember OneDrive is in the Cloud, not the university servers!).

If you need to move large and/or many files from a local machine to a remote
server (e.g. from your laptop to a Linux machine at the lab), you will
probably want to use something like FTP. For that, have a look at the guide
at:
