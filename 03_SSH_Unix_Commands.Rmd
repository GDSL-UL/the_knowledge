# SSH 

## What is SSH?

Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for accessing a computer over an unsecured network. It gives you secure access to a machine's command-line.
Secure Shell provides strong password authentication and public key authentication, as well as encrypted data communications between two computers connecting over an open network, such as the internet. However, all computers within the University of Liverpool Network are not accessible from the open internet for security reasons.
Therefore, to access a machine at the University you do not only need to be connected to the internet, but also to the Virtual Private Network (VPN) that *virtually brings you to the University of Liverpool Network*.  

## Connecting to a remote host

The use of SSH to connect to a remote host is performed through the following command:

```shell
ssh <username>@<server.ip.address>
```
  
If you are connecting to a server for the first time, then you may receive the following warning:

```
The authenticity of host 'hostIPaddress' cannot be established.
 DSA key fingerprint is 01:23:45:67:89:ab:cd:ef:ff:fe:dc:ba:98:76:54:32:10.
 Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

If this is your first time connecting to the server, or if the server has recently been reconfigured with a new key, then the above message is perfectly normal. You can proceed by typing yes and enter.  

## Unix Commands

Servers often run unix operating systems such as GNU/Linux. Unix commands are essential to perform operations from the terminal.

The following are the most frequently used commands:

### List Files:
```shell
user@host:~$ ls -lh
```

In the above example two flags have been added to the ls command:

* -l List with long format, e.g., show file read/write/execute permissions.
* -h List files with readable file size, e.g. MB, GB, etc. 

### Make Directory:

A new directory can be created using the mkdir command:

```shell
user@host:~$ mkdir <new_directory_name>
```

### Move:

The mv command command can be used to either rename or move files and folders:

```shell
user@host:~$ mv <current_filename> <new_filename>  # This is to change a file name
user@host:~$ mv <filepath> <target_directory> # This is to move a file to a folder
user@host:~$ mv -r <directory_path> <target_directory> # This is to move a folder with all its content to an other folder 
```

We add the -r (recursive) flag to move a directory and all its contents (subdirectories and files). 

### Remove:

Files and folders and can be deleted using the rm (remove) command:

```shell
user@host:~$ rm <filepath> # To delete a file
user@host:~$ rm -r <directory> # To delete a folder and its content
```

Again, we add the -r (recursive) flag to remove a directory and all its contents (subdirectories and files). 

**Warning: rm is to be used with caution. There is no trash folder from which the files can be recovered. Upon using this command the files are deleted.** 

### Change your Working Directory:

To change your working directory use the cd (change directory) command, specifying your target directory:

```shell
user@host:~$ cd <target_directory>
```

### Copy:

To copy files use cp. Again the -r flag can be added to recursively copy all files and subdirectories within a directory:

```shell
user@host:~$ cp <filename> <filecopy>
user@host:~$ cp âˆ’r <directory> <target>
```
