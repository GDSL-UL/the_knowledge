# Best Practices

Look at the Server information

Book the Server with our booking system detailing your name, short description of tasks, forseen resources used (i.e. gpu -allow memory grow-, cpu threads,ram) - the booking system will be either an excel file or a shared calendar  

Always check what are the existing images before pulling a new one with docker image ls
 
Always run docker ps to check what is running and which ports are occupied

Use htop to monitor your tasks - check memory usage and swap

Use watch -n 0.1 nvidia-smi to check GPU temperature
